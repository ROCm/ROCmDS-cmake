rapids_cpm_hipco
---------------------

.. versionadded:: v22.08.00

Allow projects to find or build `hipcollections` via `CPM` with built-in
tracking of these dependencies for correct export support.

Uses the version of hipcollections :ref:`specified in the version file <cpm_versions>` for consistency
across all RAPIDS projects.

.. note::

  If the option `HIP_AS_CUDA` is set, ``cuco``-prefixed result variables and targets are available too after calling this function.
  PACKAGE_NAME can be used to override the expected default package name "cuco" for backwards compatibility with older hipco versions,
  where the package name "hipco" was used.

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_cpm_hipco( [BUILD_EXPORT_SET <export-name>]
                   [INSTALL_EXPORT_SET <export-name>]
                   [PACKAGE_NAME <package-name>]
                   [<CPM_ARGS> ...])

.. |PKG_NAME| replace:: hipco
.. include:: common_package_args.txt

Result Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

hipco::hipco target will be created.
cuco::cuco alias target for hipco::hipco will be created (only available if HIP_AS_CUDA option is set).

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  :cmake:variable:`hipco_SOURCE_DIR` is set to the path to the source directory of hipco.
  :cmake:variable:`hipco_BINARY_DIR` is set to the path to the build directory of hipco.
  :cmake:variable:`hipco_ADDED`      is set to a true value if hipco has not been added before.
  :cmake:variable:`hipco_VERSION`    is set to the version of hipco specified by the versions.json.
  :cmake:variable:`cuco_SOURCE_DIR` Same as ``hipco_``-prefixed variable (only available if HIP_AS_CUDA option is set).
  :cmake:variable:`cuco_BINARY_DIR` Same as ``hipco_``-prefixed variable (only available if HIP_AS_CUDA option is set).
  :cmake:variable:`cuco_ADDED`      Same as ``hipco_``-prefixed variable (only available if HIP_AS_CUDA option is set).
  :cmake:variable:`cuco_VERSION`    Same as ``hipco_``-prefixed variable (only available if HIP_AS_CUDA option is set).
