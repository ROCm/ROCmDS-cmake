rapids_cpm_hipbench
------------------

.. versionadded:: v21.10.00

Allow projects to find or build `hipbench` via `CPM` with built-in
tracking of these dependencies for correct export support.

Uses the version of hipbench :ref:`specified in the version file <cpm_versions>` for consistency
across all RAPIDS projects.

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_cpm_hipbench( [BUILD_EXPORT_SET <export-name>]
                      [<CPM_ARGS> ...])

``BUILD_EXPORT_SET``
  Record that a :cmake:command:`CPMFindPackage(nvbench)` call needs to occur as part of
  our build directory export set.

``CPM_ARGS``
  Any arguments after `CPM_ARGS` will be forwarded to the underlying :cmake:command:`CPMFindPackage(<PackageName> ...)` call

.. note::

  RAPIDS-cmake will error out if an INSTALL_EXPORT_SET is provided, as nvbench
  doesn't provide any support for installation.


.. note::

  Always sets both ``hipbench``- and ``nvbench``-prefixed variables and targets.
  In contrast to other projects, ``hipBench`` provides ``nvbench``-prefixed variable and target names instead
  of `hipbench``-prefixed ones.

Result Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ``hipbench::hipbench`` target will be created.
  ``hipbench::main`` target will be created.

  ``nvbench::nvbench`` target will be created.
  ``nvbench::main`` target will be created.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  :cmake:variable:`hipbench_SOURCE_DIR` is set to the path to the source directory of nvbench.
  :cmake:variable:`hipbench_BINARY_DIR` is set to the path to the build directory of  nvbench.
  :cmake:variable:`hipbench_ADDED`      is set to a true value if nvbench has not been added before.
  :cmake:variable:`hipbench_VERSION`    is set to the version of nvbench specified by the versions.json.
  :cmake:variable:`nvbench_SOURCE_DIR` Same as ``hipbench_``-prefixed variable (always created).
  :cmake:variable:`nvbench_BINARY_DIR` Same as ``hipbench_``-prefixed variable (always created).
  :cmake:variable:`nvbench_ADDED`      Same as ``hipbench_``-prefixed variable (always created).
  :cmake:variable:`nvbench_VERSION`    Same as ``hipbench_``-prefixed variable (always created).
