rapids_cpm_libhipcxx
---------------------

.. versionadded:: v21.12.00

Allow projects to find or build `libhipcxx` via `CPM` with built-in
tracking of these dependencies for correct export support.

Uses the version of libhipcxx :ref:`specified in the version file <cpm_versions>` for consistency
across all RAPIDS projects.

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_cpm_libhipcxx( [BUILD_EXPORT_SET <export-name>]
                         [INSTALL_EXPORT_SET <export-name>]
                         [<CPM_ARGS> ...])

.. |PKG_NAME| replace:: libhipcxx
.. include:: common_package_args.txt

Result Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  libhipcxx::libhipcxx target will be created

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  :cmake:variable:`libhipcxx_SOURCE_DIR` is set to the path to the source directory of libhipcxx.
  :cmake:variable:`libhipcxx_BINARY_DIR` is set to the path to the build directory of  libhipcxx.
  :cmake:variable:`libhipcxx_ADDED`      is set to a true value if libhipcxx has not been added before.
  :cmake:variable:`libhipcxx_VERSION`    is set to the version of libhipcxx specified by the versions.json.

    # By default if we allow libhipcxx to install into `CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR` alongside rmm (or
    # other packages) we will get a install tree that looks like this:

    # install/include/rmm install/include/cub install/include/libhipcxx

    # This is a problem for CMake+NVCC due to the rules around import targets, and user/system
    # includes. In this case both rmm and libhipcxx will specify an include path of
    # `install/include`, while libhipcxx tries to mark it as an user include, since rmm uses
    # CMake's default of system include. Compilers when provided the same include as both user and
    # system always goes with system.

    # Now while rmm could also mark `install/include` as system this just pushes the issue to
    # another dependency which isn't built by RAPIDS and comes by and marks `install/include` as
    # system.

    # Instead the more reliable option is to make sure that we get libhipcxx to be placed in an
    # unique include path that the other project will use. In the case of rapids-cmake we install
    # the headers to `include/rapids/libhipcxx`
