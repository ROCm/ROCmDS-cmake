rapids_hip_init_runtime
-------------------------------

.. versionadded:: v21.06.00

Establish what HIP runtime library should be propagated

  .. code-block:: cmake

    rapids_hip_init_runtime( USE_STATIC (TRUE|FALSE) )

  Establishes what HIP runtime will be used, if not already explicitly
  specified, via the :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_HIP_RUNTIME_LIBRARY <cmake:variable:CMAKE_HIP_RUNTIME_LIBRARY>`
  variable. We also set :cmake:variable:`HIP_USE_STATIC_HIP_RUNTIME <cmake:module:FindHIP>` to control
  targets using the legacy `FindHIP.cmake`

  When `USE_STATIC TRUE` is provided all targets will link to a
    statically-linked HIP runtime library.

  When `USE_STATIC FALSE` is provided all targets will link to a
    shared-linked HIP runtime library.
